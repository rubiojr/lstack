Creates an Ubuntu Precise LXC container and installs OpenStack Icehouse on it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rubiojr/lxc-icehouse
./bootstrap.sh

All the credit goes to https://github.com/fornyx/OpenStack-Havana-Install-Guide for such an excelent guide that helped me to tame the Icehouse beast.
